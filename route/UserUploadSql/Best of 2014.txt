And baby even though I hate you
I wanna love you
I want yo-o-ou
And even though I can't forgive you
I really want to
I want yo-o-ou
Tell me tell me baby
Why can't you leave me
Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it
I want yo-o-ou
Boom-clap the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom-clap you make me feel good
Come on to me come on to me now
Why you gotta be so rude?
I want yo-o-ou
Don't you know I'm human too?
I want you
Am I wrong
For thinking that we could be something for real?
(oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh)
And am I wrong
For trying to reach the things that I can't see?
(oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh)
That's just how I feel
All about that bass bout that bass
That's just how I feel
All about that bass bout that bass
That's just how I feel
All about that bass bout that bass
Yeah your mama was right
She said don't worry about your size
Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
Cause you're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
So I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I can show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven-sins
Saw you there and I thought
Don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might look around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find my love was free
Don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, if the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space baby
And I got my head in the clouds,got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I got happy, happy, happy
